Leading a 5 people research group, I tried to distinguish the different lung diseases(COVID-19 and lung cancer) on CT image through its fractal dimension(FD). The whole dataset contains over 10k images, we calculated FD by several different methods on each whole lung CT image and lung parenchyma after image processing. We trained different machine learning models on binary classification, including neural network classifier, Support Vector Machine and K-means cluster. Finally we founded that SVM was the most effective classifier, with 96% of accuracy.

The group is consist of 3 students in HZAU. We tried to determine whether plants are lack of water through the outcomes including leafs color, shape and height. To achieve that, we collected depth images and RGB images from different angles by Kinect tool and infrared camera. Based on those images, we calculated the FD of each image and found the relation between water content and FD.
