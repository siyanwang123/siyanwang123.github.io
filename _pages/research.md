I led a 5 people research group and distinguished the difference of fractal dimension (FD) on lung CT images with different diseases (COVID-19 and lung cancer) and without. The whole dataset contains over 10k images, we calculated FD by several different methods on each whole lung CT image and its lung parenchyma after image processing. We developed different machine learning models on binary classification, including neural network classifier, Support Vector Machine and K-means cluster. Finally we found that SVM was the most accurate classifier, with 96% of accuracy.

The research group is consists of 3 students in HZAU. We focused on making decision of water deficiency in plants through their outcomes of leafs color, shape and plants height. We collected depth images and RGB images from different angles by Kinect tool and infrared camera as dataset. Leveraging these sophisticated imaging methodologies, we meticulously calculated the fractal dimension (FD) for each image with different methods. Our investigation was to establish robust correlations between water content and FD values, underlining our commitment to rigorous scientific inquiry and meticulous data analysis.
