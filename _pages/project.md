In this project, we implemented Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification on a dataset composed of 10 classes of fruits and investigated the performances of MLP and CNN. We found that CNN outperformed MLP on this dataset. Additionally, we explored how three different activation functions perform on CNN: rectified linear unit (ReLU), hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and sigmoid, and compare the test accuracy, time consumption, and vanishing gradient. ReLu is proven to have better overall performance than the other two methods, as it proves the accuracy by more than 4%. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using CNN for fruit classification and the importance of selecting an appropriate activation function which is ReLU in our project.

In order to give more specific advice for Bakery shops in Santa Barbara, we seperate the dataset into two groups: opened and closed. We do exploratory data analsis (word cloud, bakery shop distribution map in Santa Barbara, etc.) to extract information from reviews and see the impact of shop distribution. We also analyzed customer's attitude towards each store in five aspect: drink,food, ambiance, service and price. The results are combined in a [shiny app](https://niharika-chunduru.shinyapps.io/Yelp-Bakeries-Analysis) for easy usage of store owners.
